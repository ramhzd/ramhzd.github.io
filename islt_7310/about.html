     <!-- Paragraph -->
     <p>
        I graduated in 2002 from Southeast Missouri State University with a Business Administration degree. Now, I'm the Director of Technology at Notre Dame Regional High School. I love both technology and education. For more than 20 years, I've been learning and getting better at helping students, parents, and teachers. My job is to fix things and make new, creative solutions to help the school's technology.

        I also really enjoy coaching our schoolâ€™s robotics team. It's a big part of my journey. I teach and help young minds grow with technology. Besides my school job, I'm also a tech specialist at Amerimart stores. I help with tech stuff for school and stores. I make sure people can easily understand the important information.

        My family makes me very happy, and they're really important to me. We do fun things together. 

                 <br>
                 I also play racquetball to stay balanced and healthy, just like I balance my work and family.
