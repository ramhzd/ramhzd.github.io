      FTC Robotics stands for "First Tech Challenge Robotics." It is a competitive robotics program specifically designed for middle and high school students. FTC is one of the programs offered by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a non-profit organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen. FTC provides students with the opportunity to design, build, and program robots to compete in challenging and exciting games and tasks.

    <p class="larger-header">Here are some key points about FTC Robotics:</p>
    <main-ul>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Teams:</strong> FTC Robotics teams are typically composed of students, mentors, and coaches who work together to design and build a robot. Teams can be affiliated with schools, community organizations, or even formed by groups of interested students.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Each FTC season, a new game or challenge is introduced that requires teams to design and program a robot capable of completing specific tasks. These challenges are designed to be both fun and educational.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Programming:</strong> FTC emphasizes the importance of programming as part of the robot design process. Teams use programming languages like Java or Blockly to control their robots and make them perform various actions autonomously or under driver control.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Engineering and Innovation:</strong> FTC encourages students to think creatively, solve problems, and apply engineering principles to their robot designs. It provides a hands-on experience in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Competitions:</strong> FTC teams participate in regional, state, and sometimes international competitions. These events are not only about competition but also about learning, sharing ideas, and collaborating with other teams.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gracious Professionalism:</strong> FIRST promotes the concept of "Gracious Professionalism," which encourages teams to compete vigorously but also to help and support each other. It promotes a positive and cooperative atmosphere among participants.
