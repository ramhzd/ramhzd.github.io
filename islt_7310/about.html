    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <!-- Paragraph -->
    <p>
        I am a graduate of Southeast Missouri State University, holding a degree in Business Administration. Seamlessly merging my passions for technology and education, I currently serve as the Director of Technology at Notre Dame Regional High School. With my professional journey spanning over two decades, I've honed my skills to cater to students, parents, and educators. My role involves troubleshooting and implementing innovative solutions to enhance the school's technological landscape.

        A significant part of my journey involves guiding our schoolâ€™s FTC robotics team, where my enthusiasm thrives. I actively coach and nurture young minds, guiding them toward technological brilliance. Beyond my school responsibilities, I also work as a tech specialist for Amerimart convenience stores. This dual role allows me to span both educational and commercial tech realms, always with a focus on essential reader engagement.
        
        Amidst my professional pursuits, my family remains my core source of joy, anchoring my life. Together, we craft memorable moments. To maintain equilibrium, I indulge in invigorating racquetball matches, mirroring the dedication that drives all my endeavors
                <br>
        I believe that every experience is an opportunity for growth, and I'm dedicated to continuously improving myself both personally and professionally.
